  "gamemechanicinfo-shipbuilding-text": "<strong>Sailboat Construction</strong><br><br>Constructing a <a href=\"handbooksearch://sailboat\">sailboat</a> requires a great deal of materials, and many steps.  But it all starts with simple <a href=\"handbook://item-roller\">rollers</a>. Craft five rollers and select them in your hotbar: an in-world schematic will appear. You can change the direction the schematic faces using the <hk>toolmodeselect</hk> key. Place the rollers on a flat area (making sure the blue highlighted schematic strip is in water).<br><br>Afterward, if you have block interaction help turned on (toggle with <hk>blockinteractionhelp</hk>), looking at the in-process boat will show you the next required ingredients.  You will need logs and boards of the same species of tree.  Beyond that you will need more <a href=\"handbook://item-firewood\">firewood</a>, two <a href=\"handbook://item-plumbandsquare\">plumb-and-squares</a>, and <a href=\"handbook://item-rope\">rope</a>.  Once you have completed and launched the boat, you can also add <a href=\"handbook://item-ratlines\">ratlines</a> to allow you to climb to the top of the mast. See the <a href=\"handbooksearch://sailboat\">sailboat</a> handbook entry for more information on how to equip your new sailboat.<br>You can deconstruct the sailboat to get a portion of the materials back, by <hk>rightmouse</hk> it with a <a href=\"handbooksearch://saw\">saw</a>.  You will have to hold the mouse button down for some time, before this will be completed.",
  "item-handbooktitle-boat-sailed-*": "How to Construct",
  "item-handbooktext-boat-sailed-*": "Sailboats are constructed in place on land, and then rolled into the water.  They cannot be picked up.  They can be deconstructed by holding down <hk>rightmouse</hk> with a <a href=\"handbooksearch://saw\">saw</a>.  See the <a href=\"handbook://gamemechanicinfo-shipbuilding\">Building A Sailboat</a> entry for more information.<br><br><strong>Movement</strong><br>Once you have constructed your sailboat, <hk>rightmouse</hk> click on the starboard aft seat (by the tiller at the stern) to sit in that seat: only that seat can control the boat. With the sails furled, you can use normal navigation keys to move the boat slowly. <hk>rightmouse</hk>-click on the cleat on the side of the mast (where a rope is tied) to unfurl the sail and pick up speed. The sailboat currently does not respond to wind direction, only your movement keys.<br><br>If the boat becomes grounded or in water that is too shallow, it can be moved very slowly using the arrow keys, but only with the sail furled again.<br><br><strong>Equipping</strong><br>Most boat accessories are added to the boat via <hk>ctrl</hk> + <hk>rightmouse</hk>.<br>The boat can also hold several passengers - in every boat, one passenger can sit on the port-side aft seat (adjacent to the player who is at the tiller controlling the boat).  Additional <a href=\"handbooksearch://boat seat\">seats</a> can be added to any of the eight cargo hold spots.<br><br>You can place containers (including chests, baskets, and storage vessels) in the hold of the boat, and access them on or off the boat.<br><br>You can also place a mount (such as an elk) on the boat by first placing a <a href=\"handbooksearch://wooden fence\">wooden fence post</a> in one of the cargo spots - being sure to leave 2 cargo spots empty aft of the post - and then using a <a href=\"handbook://item-rope\">rope</a> on this fence post, which will place the animal into the aft cargo spots. You can then disembark the animal using <hk>rightmouse</hk> on the fence post.<br><br>You can attach a <a href=\"handbooksearch://lantern\">lantern</a> to the aft face of the mast (about 3 meters up) to provide light.<br><br><a href=\"handbook://item-ratlines\">Ratlines</a> can be attached to the gunwhales on each side of the mast in order to allow you to climb to the top of the mast to look around.<br><br>An <a href=\"handbook://item-anchor-stone\">anchor</a> can be placed in the front-left space in the prow (though currently the anchor has no function).<br><br>There is also a spot at the prow for a <a href=\"handbooksearch://figurehead\">figurehead</a> to be placed (you can also place your own chiseled figurehead there), and on the port bow, your boat can be named (using pigment and <hk>shift</hk> + <hk>rightmouse</hk>-click).",
